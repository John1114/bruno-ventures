Tailwind CSS, Next.js, Firebase

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Set up Firebase by creating a `.env` file based on the contents of `example.env` and adding your Firebase project
credentials.

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Using the Firebase SDK

To access the Firebase SDK, you need to use an initialized instance of the Firebase app. To do so, use `firebaseClient` (exported from `util/firebaseClient.ts`).

After importing `firebaseClient`, you can use this to access the Firebase SDK.

Example:
```typescript=
import firebaseClient from "../util/firebaseClient.ts";

const firestore = firebaseClient.firestore();
```

## Firebase Auth

To access Firebase Authentication from anywhere within the app, use the custom `useAuth()` hook. 

```javascript
const {isAuthenticated, isLoading, user} = useAuth();
```

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use
the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme)
from the creators of Next.js.
